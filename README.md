## Overview
This project introduces an advanced security system for Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) utilizing two main technologies:
1. **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Enables users to input PINs without physically typing on a keyboard.
2. **Hand Vein Recognition**: Ensures secure biometric verification.

These technologies aim to provide a higher level of security and accessibility, particularly for visually impaired users, while minimizing vulnerabilities like shoulder surfing and replication risks associated with fingerprint systems.

## Problem Statement
ATMs are an essential part of modern banking. However, traditional PIN-based and biometric verification systems are prone to security issues, such as fingerprint replication and shoulder surfing. This project seeks to mitigate these issues by employing:
- Gesture-based PIN entry.
- Hand vein recognition for biometric authentication.

---

## Motivation
The proposed system enhances ATM security while ensuring ease of use. Key motivations include:
- **Security**: Vein patterns are nearly impossible to replicate.
- **Accessibility**: Gesture recognition aids visually impaired users.
- **Cost-efficiency**: Leveraging sensors reduces overall costs compared to traditional methods.

## Methodology
### System Components:
1. **Gesture Recognition**:
   - A custom user interface for PIN entry ([Figure 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nZ12De1p_cAfMZ1_iRCHZjCuknBrHuU/view?usp=sharing).
   - Hand gestures recognized via a sensor-based setup ([Figure 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1318PCiAmSEBK3cbzYivMQCERtP50n_a3/view?usp=sharing)).

2. **Hand Vein Recognition**:
   - Raspberry Pi-based hardware for vein scanning ([Figure 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p91zDO02wrdV-B9d064FWvIZ2wCxgmxA/view?usp=sharing)).
   - Image processing techniques to analyze and verify vein patterns ([Figure 4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tz6hkwKDm3SNDaDXXwO71BSy-HpKSd3r/view?usp=sharing).

## Results and Discussion
- **Gesture Recognition**:
  - Reliable PIN input without requiring physical interaction ([Figure 5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18FVX3V9g_HYjFMuQOpjaANa-v23_eJs6/view?usp=sharing)).
  - Effective in reducing shoulder surfing risks.

- **Hand Vein Recognition**:
  - Highly reliable compared to fingerprints ([Figure 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tb42tWd2wb8QBxAV_cZvFVkp36Mu2Myj/view?usp=sharing)).
  - Requires less storage space than face recognition systems.

### Cost Analysis:
- Estimated cost using traditional sensors: **$400**.
- Proposed system cost: **< $80**.

---

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust and cost-effective solution to ATM security. By integrating gesture-based PIN entry and hand vein recognition, the system enhances security and usability, especially for visually impaired users. Future work could explore:
- Expanding the system to other domains.
- Integrating additional biometric methods.
